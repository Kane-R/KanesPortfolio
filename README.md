# KanesPortfolio
Responsive and constantly evolving portfolio website built by and featuring the work of Kane Robinson.


NOTES: (applicable to whole project):
1. Codebase and file/folder data & structure requires 'cleaning' and consolidation as many assets copied in from 3x themes, copied snippets containing stylesheet references, etc
2. Responsiveness not ideal for large screen MB's (ie Galaxy Note 9) on portofilio.html and contact.html
3. Consider/Check if head script/links need to be updated - all pages
4. Check netlify and other options for deployment/hosting


HOMEPAGE - LATEST CHANGES: 2020-02-21:
1. For HOMEWORK BONUS - Added nested rows and columns in the "so whats so special?" section
2. Fixed up code indentation and line-spaces on all html and css files
3. Tidied up and added more notes & comments to html and css files for better readibility


HOMEPAGE NOTES:
1. Check all items in <head> section – may need updating, some items could be removed
2. Check all styles - consolidate and purge unused
3. Slight inconsistency on nav bar between all pages
4. Page load animation (“Preloader”) not working (works on contact.html and portfolio.html)
5. Page-up icon which (should be on bottom right) not setup (works on contact.html and portfolio.html)
6. Video file for header background very large (50MB)
7. Add links to Footer and add/swap more useful info
8. Nav Bar and Footer duplicated on all pages – reference common items to single source
